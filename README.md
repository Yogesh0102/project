## Project 

In todays global age the world has shrunk to a much smaller place, But that is another way of saying **you can have food and flavours from around the world** at your doorstep. This project helps those foodies that are in need of something new to eat. Our site also takes care of **health conscious** people as it can show the amount of `nutrients` as well as `calories` of each dish.

Also if clicked on your interested dish, you are transferred to a new site with recipe of the dish.
